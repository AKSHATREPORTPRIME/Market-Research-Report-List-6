<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Drive Shaft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Half Shaft</li><li>Propeller Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car drive shaft market includes two main types: **Half Shaft** and **Propeller Shaft**. The **Half Shaft** connects the differential to the wheels, transmitting power in front or rear-wheel-drive vehicles. It is typically shorter and used in independent suspension systems. The **Propeller Shaft** (or drive shaft) links the transmission to the differential, transferring torque in rear or all-wheel-drive vehicles. It is longer and often used in vehicles with solid rear axles. Both are critical for power transmission, ensuring smooth vehicle operation.</p></p>
