<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Rhythm Management Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICDs</li><li>CRT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Implantable Cardiac Rhythm Management Device market comprises three primary types: Pacemakers, Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) devices. Pacemakers regulate heartbeats in patients with bradycardia, ensuring consistent rhythm. ICDs are designed to detect and correct life-threatening arrhythmias, delivering shocks if necessary. CRT devices improve heart function by synchronizing contractions in patients with heart failure. Together, these devices enhance patient outcomes and quality of life while addressing various cardiac issues.</p></p>
