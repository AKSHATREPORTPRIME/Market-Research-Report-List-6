<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chip Level Underfill Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluid Filler</li><li>Non Flowing Filler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chip-level underfill market comprises two primary types: fluid fillers and non-flowing fillers. Fluid fillers are low-viscosity materials that flow into the gaps between the chip and substrate, providing superior thermal and mechanical protection. They are commonly used in high-density packaging applications. Non-flowing fillers, on the other hand, are paste-like substances that stay in place once applied, offering stronger adhesion and stability but requiring precise dispensing. Both types are crucial for enhancing the durability and performance of microelectronics.</p></p>
