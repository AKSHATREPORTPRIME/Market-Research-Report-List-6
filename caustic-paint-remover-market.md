<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Caustic Paint Remover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oily</li><li>Paste</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Caustic paint removers are chemical solutions used to strip paint from surfaces. The **oily** type is a liquid formulation with a greasy texture, ideal for vertical surfaces as it clings well, preventing drips. The **paste** type is thicker, offering better adhesion on uneven or horizontal surfaces, ensuring prolonged contact for effective paint removal. Both types contain caustic agents that break down paint layers, but their consistency determines their application suitability, with oily being more versatile and paste providing targeted, controlled removal.</p></p>
