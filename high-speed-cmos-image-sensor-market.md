<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Speed CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS</li><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The High Speed CMOS Image Sensor market includes two primary types: Front-Illuminated (FI) CMOS and Backside-Irradiated (BSI) CMOS sensors. FI CMOS sensors capture light from the front, relying on micro-lenses to improve light collection, making them less efficient in low-light conditions. Conversely, BSI CMOS sensors have their circuitry behind the light-sensitive areas, enhancing light absorption and enabling superior performance in dim environments. This distinction drives application choices in industries ranging from consumer electronics to automotive and surveillance.</p></p>
