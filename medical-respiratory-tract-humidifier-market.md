<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Respiratory Tract Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical respiratory tract humidifier market features two primary types: active and passive humidifiers. Active humidifiers actively add moisture to the air by heating water or using ultrasonic technology, providing precise humidity control and warmer gases for patient comfort. Passive humidifiers, on the other hand, rely on ambient conditions to increase humidity, often utilizing exhaled moisture to humidify incoming air, making them more energy-efficient but less precise. Both types serve to enhance respiratory therapy by maintaining optimal airway humidity.</p></p>
