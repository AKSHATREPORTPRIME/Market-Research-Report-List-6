<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitinol based Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitinol-based stents are commonly used in treating cardiovascular diseases. Two main types of Nitinol stents are Bare-metal Stents (BMS) and Drug-eluting Stents (DES). BMS are made of Nitinol alloy and provide structural support to keep the arteries open. On the other hand, DES are coated with medications to prevent restenosis. The DES market is rapidly growing due to its ability to reduce the risk of re-narrowing of arteries compared to BMS. Both types of stents are widely used in interventional cardiology.</p></p>
