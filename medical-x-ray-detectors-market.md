<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical X-ray detectors are classified into two main types - indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors convert X-rays into light, which is then converted into electrical signals for image processing. Direct conversion detectors directly convert X-rays into electrical signals, eliminating the need for additional conversion steps. Indirect conversion detectors are typically less expensive but produce lower image quality, while direct conversion detectors offer higher image quality but are more costly. Both types are widely used in medical imaging for diagnosing various conditions.</p></p>
