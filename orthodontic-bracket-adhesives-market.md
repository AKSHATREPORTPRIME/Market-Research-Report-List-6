<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orthodontic Bracket Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Light-Curable</li><li>Chemical-Curable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Orthodontic bracket adhesives are used for bonding brackets to teeth during orthodontic treatment. There are two main types of bracket adhesives: light-curable and chemical-curable. Light-curable adhesives are cured using a blue light, allowing for quicker bonding times and easier clean-up. Chemical-curable adhesives require a chemical reaction to set, which can take longer but may provide a stronger bond. Both types have their own advantages and are commonly used in orthodontic practices based on the specific needs of the patient and the preference of the orthodontist.</p></p>
