<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifocal Toric Intraocular Lens IOLs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Not Pre-loaded IOLs</li><li>Pre-loaded IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multifocal Toric Intraocular Lens (IOLs) can be categorized into two main types based on loading mechanism: Not Pre-loaded IOLs and Pre-loaded IOLs. Not Pre-loaded IOLs require manual loading of the lens into the injector by the surgeon before implantation, while Pre-loaded IOLs come already mounted in the injector, making the implantation process more efficient and reducing the risk of contamination. Both types offer the benefits of multifocality and astigmatism correction for patients undergoing cataract surgery.</p></p>
