<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poultry and Livestock Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccine</li><li>Inactivated vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The poultry and livestock vaccines market comprises two main types: live vaccines and inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines utilize weakened forms of pathogens to stimulate an immune response, providing robust, long-lasting immunity with fewer doses. They are often more effective against specific diseases. In contrast, inactivated vaccines contain killed pathogens, ensuring safety while still eliciting an immune response. Although they may require multiple doses for effective immunity, they are preferred in sensitive populations, reducing the risk of disease spread.</p></p>
